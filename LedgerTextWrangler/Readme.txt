To install, simply copy Ledger.plist into ~/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Language Modules (create the directory if it does not exist). Then, restart TextWrangler. Note that syntax coloring works better when the currency goes /after/ the amount.

Take a look at the comments inside Ledger.plist if you want to customize it.
